# BUILD LOG — chaos→structure catalog engine (14 meta-mechanisms)

10-hour autonomous build on v40 (281 files / 56,289 lines). Honest accounting per §1.4: "100% implemented" =
every transform has an HONEST entry (VERIFIED or UNVERIFIED(reason)) — NOT 100% passing. New kernels enter the
`kernel_router` REGISTRY only behind the §7 gate. Three clocks never mixed; fold = Clock C.

---

## PHASE A — skeleton (mechanisms/ + catalog/ + compose + decline_boundary) ✅

**What:** built the catalog-engine backbone on top of the existing `kernel_router.REGISTRY` + `kernel_verdict` ADT.

- `mechanisms/` — the 14 meta-mechanisms (1..14) + 2 cross-cutting primitives (Legendre duality, symmetry
  reduction), each a `Mechanism(probe, apply, cert_kinds, contract, composable_with)`. Real cheap `probe`s
  ([0,1]^14 routing signal); `apply`s return an honest `HONEST_DEFER` DECLINE (sound logic lands in PHASE B–F —
  no fake pass, no gateless kernel in REGISTRY). Framework CLOSED: closure_report → no 15th mechanism; ur-form
  annotations on M1/M13/M14.
- `catalog/` — `Transform` registry: **94 transforms** registered = the §4 named representatives across all 9
  passes (1-6:16, A-1:7, A-2:6, B-1:7, B-2:9, C-1:6, C-2:12, D-1:14, D-2:17). All 14 mechanisms have ≥1 transform;
  **38 are compositions** (deep results = mechanism composition, §3.4). (§0's "~190" is the broader research
  catalog; §4 enumerates 94 named representatives — these are registered 100%.)
- `catalog/compose.py` — §5 router skeleton: DECLINE-guard → existing-fold short-circuit → 14-probe vector →
  composition pipeline plan (`mechanism_path`). Real gated composition lands in PHASE E; PHASE A returns an honest
  DECLINE naming the planned path (never a fake result).
- `catalog/decline_boundary.py` — §6 backbone: Rice / incompressibility / turbulence guards (conservative keyword
  heuristics at PHASE A; real tests in PHASE D) + the 15-entry proven-boundary list.
- `test_catalog.py` — standalone suite; **6/6 green** (mechanisms closed, probe routing, honest coverage, DECLINE
  backbone, router, no-unverified-autoselect).

**Measured:** catalog coverage = 94 registered / 0 VERIFIED / 94 honest-deferred (PHASE A registers the catalog;
gated kernels follow). Router smoke: fold→EXACT[13] (Σk²→n(n+1)(2n+1)/6), Rice→DECLINE[14], SOS→DEFER plan[4→14],
classify→DEFER plan[9→2].

**Existing suite:** unaffected — PHASE A is purely additive (no existing file modified); `test_build` still
collects 273; new packages import cleanly alongside it.

**Deferred (K=94, reason):** every transform `apply` is HONEST_DEFER pending its PHASE (B: SOS/Presburger/RCF/ACF;
C: ordinal/NbE/arith-hierarchy; D: DECLINE guards; E: composition; F: domain applies). No gateless kernel registered.

**15th-mechanism candidate:** none — framework closed (D-1·D-2 reconfirmed).
