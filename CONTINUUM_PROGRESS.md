# CONTINUUM_PROGRESS — the endless deepening log (research → judge → build → verify → commit → reflect)

Each row is ONE real, measured, ADT-graded, committed increment that raises ACCURACY or SPEED. Failures are
§A2 substitutions, never stops. Honesty absolute: measured whole-program, ratio ≤ ceiling, kernel ≠ whole-
program, approximation/randomized ⇒ PROBABILISTIC with ε,δ (never EXACT), sandbox-blocked ⇒ UNVERIFIED.
Deterministic suite: `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 python3 test_build.py`.

NOTE: this continues the OMEGA Tier-2 / Round-3 verification deepening (raising the EXACT share). The formal
§D loop is reserved for after all of §A+§B+§C are checked; this log tracks the ongoing measured increments now.

| axis | increment | grade | measured | test | suite |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|------|-------|
| ACC | #67 machine-faithful translation validation (bitvector/overflow) | EXACT | 5 sound peepholes EXACT; 3 overflow-unsafe REFUTED+cex; (x+1)>x ℤ-PROVEN/bv32-REFUTED@INT_MAX | test_round3_bitvector_translation_validation | 154/154 |
| ACC | #68 purity → EXACT memoization (caught+fixed a global-mutation false-pure soundness bug) | EXACT | pure ~74×; random+global-mutating ⇒ DECLINE | test_round3_purity_memoization_exact | 155/155 |
| ACC | #72 complexity certificate (asymptotic class, not constant) | PROBABILISTIC | O(n²)→O(n) exp 2.05→0.96 Δ=1.09; same-class⇒DECLINE | test_round3_complexity_certificate | 156/156 |
| ACC | #71 termination via ranking functions (Z3) | EXACT | 4 loops proven; increasing/step-over-zero ⇒ DECLINE+witness | test_round3_termination_ranking | 157/157 |
| ACC | #70 interval/range analysis → EXACT no-overflow fast path (unifies NTT/matmul bound) | EXACT | conv |v|≤2e8⊂int64 EXACT; >2^63 / int32 ⇒ DECLINE; over-approx brute-checked | test_round3_interval_range_analysis | 158/158 |

Reflect: the EXACT-promotion + sound-static-analysis cluster is filling out (Round-3 Group P/Q). Next bottleneck:
unbounded-loop invariants (#61 BMC, #65 k-induction) and verification SPEED (#63 SMT portfolio), then SPEED
big-multiplier broth families (segment tree / Dijkstra-heap / suffix structures).
| SPEED | big-multiplier recognizer: Dijkstra naive O(V²) → heap O((V+E)·log V) | PROBABILISTIC | ~28×@V=1500 sparse; wrong (drops edge weight)→DECLINE | test_round1_big_recognizers | 158/158 |
| ACC | #65 k-induction — closed form / invariant proven for UNBOUNDED n (bounded→all-n EXACT promotion) | EXACT | Σi, Faulhaber Σi², Σodd, x%2==0, x≥0 ∀n; non-inductive (n(n+1)/2,n²)→DECLINE | test_round3_kinduction_unbounded | 159/159 |
| SPEED | big-multiplier recognizer: LIS naive O(n²) DP → patience/binary-search O(n log n) | PROBABILISTIC | ~430×@n=3000; wrong (bisect_right⇒non-strict)→DECLINE on duplicates | test_round1_big_recognizers | 159/159 |
| ACC | #69 alias / loop-carried dependence analysis (Z3) → safe parallelize | EXACT | 3 loops proven independent (parallel-safe); 2 real dependences → DECLINE+witness | test_round3_aliasing_dependence | 160/160 |
| SPEED | big-multiplier recognizer: rectangle-sum queries O(Q·h·w) → summed-area table O(h·w + Q) | PROBABILISTIC | ~42×@200×200,3000q; wrong (drops inclusion-exclusion corner)→DECLINE | test_round1_big_recognizers | 160/160 |

Reflect: Round-3 Group P/Q verification cluster largely complete (#65,67,68,69,70,71,72); 9 big-multiplier
recognizers (fib/KMP/union-find/coin/fenwick/RMQ/dijkstra/LIS/summed-area). Horner SUBSTITUTED (§A2: Z3 unknown
on the nonlinear identity → couldn't earn EXACT; replaced with summed-area). Next: #61 BMC, #63 SMT portfolio,
#73 effects, #74 interprocedural summaries; then SPEED broth families + Clock-A/B throughput.
| ACC | #74 interprocedural purity summaries (call-graph fixpoint) → EXACT memoization | EXACT | proves a top-level fn pure that single-fn #68 rejects (calls helpers) ⇒ memoize ~76×; impure-helper caller → DECLINE | test_round3_interprocedural_purity | 161/161 |
| ACC | #61 BMC — bounded-depth equivalence (∀inputs ≤k) + shallowest counterexample | EXACT (bounded-depth) | equivalent opt EXACT to depth 6; off-by-one→DECLINE@depth1 (x=11); clamp bug→DECLINE@SHALLOWEST depth 2 (trace) | test_round3_bmc_bounded_equiv | 162/162 |
| SPEED+ACC | #73 effects analysis → reorder/coalesce; idempotent reads N→1 round-trips | EXACT | reorderable proven; reads coalesced 4000→40 ~85×; intervening write/RAW/ordered-I/O → DECLINE | test_round3_effects_reorder_coalesce | 163/163 |

Reflect: ROUND 3 Group P + Q essentially complete (#61,65,67 P-built + 62,66 verify-existing; #63 SMT-portfolio,
#64 CEGAR remain in P; Q all done #68-74). EXACT-share keeps climbing via sound static analyses + bounded/
unbounded proofs. Next: #63 SMT portfolio (Clock-B speed), #64 CEGAR, then SPEED broth families + Clock-A/B.
| SPEED | #63 cheap-first verification tiering (Clock-B) — syntactic→interval→Z3 | EXACT (sound fast path) | Z3 calls 9→2 (4.5× fewer); cheap tiers cross-checked sound vs Z3; disagreeing tier→DECLINE | test_round3_verification_tiering | 164/164 |
| ACC | #64 CEGAR — refine loop invariant until inductive & strong enough | EXACT | x≠51 PROVEN via refining predicate x%2==0; false x≠50 → REFUTED (bounded-reach witness) | test_round3_cegar_refinement | 165/165 |

Reflect: ROUND 3 COMPLETE (Group P #61,63,64,65,67 built + #62,66 verify-existing; Group Q #68-74 all built).
EXACT-share majority. Next per CONTINUUM: SPEED broth families + Clock-A/B throughput, more big-multipliers.
| SPEED | big-multiplier recognizer: accidental O(n²) string-build (subscript-target concat) → list+join O(n) | PROBABILISTIC | ~452×@n=16000 (the common AI antipattern; CPython's in-place += opt does NOT apply to a subscript/attr target); wrong order→DECLINE | test_round1_big_recognizers | 165/165 |
| ACC+SPEED | polynomial degree-≤2 loop-sum Σ(a·i²+b·i+c) → Faulhaber closed form, EXACT for ALL n (k-induction) | EXACT | O(n)→O(1) ~23611×@n=200000, proven ∀n (base+step), δ=None; wrong closed form fails step→DECLINE | test_continuum_polysum_kinduction_exact | 166/166 |
