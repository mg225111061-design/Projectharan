# ROUND 2 / 10 — ~80% unstructured code, Ω(N) side-doors, waiting-elimination (live tracker)

DoD per item: fires → fix → measured whole-program (+f+ceiling, ratio≤ceiling, n quoted; +ε,δ for
approximation/speculation) → graded by ADT → adversarial-wrong→DECLINE test → committed → ticked with commit +
test. Approximation/speculation = PROBABILISTIC with REPORTED ε,δ, never EXACT. Honest UNVERIFIED[reason] where
a sandbox limit blocks. Suite green each item.

RESUME POINTER: Round 2 started — item 46 done; next 49(Bloom)/36(async)/47(HLL). (Round 1 — items 7,9,10,11,12,14 done; 1,3,5,6,16,20,22,25,26,29,30 pending; 2,4,8,13,15,17,18,19,21,23,24,27,28 verify-existing). Start Round 2 at item 31 after Round 1 lands.

Tooling probed: llvmlite 0.47 ✓, numba 0.65 ✓ (items 31,33 buildable native), orjson/msgpack ✗ (item 40 → marshal real + orjson/msgpack UNVERIFIED[lib]), concurrent.futures/threading/multiprocessing ✓ (36,38,39,42 buildable).

38. ◩ auto-parallelize independent loops — covered by offload (Amdahl-gated, dominant→offload/non-dominant→DECLINE) [test_pillar3_stage5_offload] + monoid #39 (associativity license) [test_round2_monoid_mapreduce]
39. ☑ map-reduce / monoid recognition (Z3) — operator associativity PROVEN ⇒ tree/parallel reduction ≡ sequential fold EXACT (data-parallel-safe; add/mul/max/min/or); non-associative (subtract/average)→DECLINE+counterexample [test_round2_monoid_mapreduce; pillar3/monoid.py]
40. ☑ serialization swap json→marshal — lossless round-trip (verified) ~3.3× PROBABILISTIC; lossy serializer→DECLINE; orjson/msgpack ⚠[lib absent] [test_round2_serialization_swap; round2.py]
## Group I — waiting-elimination (bet on the future, NOT caching)
41. ☑ speculative execution + rollback (waiting-elimination, NOT caching) — bet on predicted next query during idle, latency hidden on hits; PROBABILISTIC reporting misspeculation δ=0.15 (latency-critical compute 2000→304); correctness-checked; random stream δ≈1→DECLINE [test_round2_speculative_execution; pillar3/speculation.py]

## Group K — memory/allocation/GC
51. ☐ allocation elimination / object pooling
