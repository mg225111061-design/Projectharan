# STATUS — MR.JEFFREY / HARAN  (single source of truth)

*This is the ONE document that states what is true NOW. Autonomous builds update THIS file rather than spawning a
new top-level report. Historical campaign reports live in `reports/archive/`. Every number here is reproduced by
`test_build.py` — if a number drifts, the build is wrong, not this file. Last verified: fresh suite run below.*

## Grades (the ADT, enforced at construction — `kernel_verdict.py`)
- **EXACT** — machine-checked certificate / decision procedure / exhaustive-bounded domain (bound stated).
- **PROBABILISTIC(ε,δ)** — approximation/randomized; δ stated; never EXACT even at δ≤10⁻¹⁸.
- **DECLINE** — irreducible / undecidable / no closed form / unstructured. Dignified, proven, never a fabrication.
- A wrong "EXACT" is a correctness bug; the adversarial battery injects fake-EXACT / rubber-stamp / grade-mismatch and the ADT rejects every one (`test_moat_battery`, `test_*_dogfood`).

## CODE mode (pillar3 / webapi / server)
- OMEGA Rounds 1–3 fully dispositioned (90/90). EXACT-share ≈ **68%** of graded capabilities (`exact_share.py`).
- Recognizers + verified lifting + e-graph + superopt + sound static analyses; fast/normal/extend mode separation.

## MATH mode (`mathmode/`, 22 modules)
- Center: **`fold`** — recognize structure → closed form + co-generated certificate, or honest DECLINE.
- **`broth`** — O(1) lookup over 3,772 proven entries (Gosper-grown hypergeometric family; ~0.09µs lookup).
- Arsenal families: number_theory (egcd/modinv/CRT/modexp/Diophantine/primality/factorize/φ/discrete-log/√/Pell) ·
  combinatorics (Gosper, binomial, Catalan) · linear_algebra (solve/inverse/det/eigen) ·
  algebra (factor/gcd/roots/interpolate/partial-fractions/systems) · geometry · certified_numeric (Sturm/IVT/√/Monte-Carlo) ·
  optimization (LP duality) · science_engineering (dimensional) · probability (Markov/Chebyshev) ·
  inequalities (nonneg/SOS) · differential (ODE) · graph (shortest-path/bipartite) · special_functions (Γ/ζ) ·
  calculus (∫/d/dx/Taylor) · logic (Z3 SAT/tautology/equiv).
- Entry point `solver.py`: free-text/JSON → `solve_in_mode(mode)`; `MathSolution.trace()` shows grade-tagged reasoning.
- Measured coverage (`benchmark.py`): **41 problems / 16 domains — EXACT 32, PROBABILISTIC 1, DECLINE 8**, all
  matching expected grade, 26 cross-checked vs ground truth. Demonstration: `reports/archive/MATH_SHOWCASE.md`.

## §B UI (served single-file `mrjeffrey.html`)
- CODE ⇄ MATH toggle (re-themes + re-routes); fast/normal/extend preserved inside each.
- Universal file attachment (drag-drop + picker) → `/api/math/ingest`; fold-accelerated analysis.
- Safe archive extraction (`archive.py`): zip/tar/gz, in-memory, zip-slip + decompression-bomb defenses.

## Module families (C4 — analyzed; not the trivial dups the review assumed)
A dependency-mapped review (importers per module) found these are **layered, distinct-consumer modules, not
literal copies** — so a behaviour-preserving merge is a real refactor, not a delete:
- **e-graph (4):** `egraph` (core engine) · `equality_saturation` (e-graph + Z3-extraction — the MATH `fold`'s
  critical path) · `fold_egraph` (fold-rules **already reusing `egraph`**, i.e. an adapter) · `egraph_native`
  (extracted-term → LLVM emit). Four pipeline STAGES, not four engines. The two cores (`egraph` /
  `equality_saturation`) genuinely overlap → **unification folds INTO §1** (the native term core becomes the one
  canonical engine; merging Python now then rewriting in Rust would be wasted work).
- **spec_* (6):** a LAYERED toolkit, not dups — `spec_strengthen`→`spec_strength_gate`, `spec_infer`→`spec_fragment`,
  `spec_gate`←prove_exact/measure, `spec_propagation`←proof_dag; `spec_strengthen`/`spec_propagation` are
  **tested** (not dead). Kept; the layering is intentional and documented.
- **frontends (6):** distinct LANGUAGES (c/go/java/js/native…), not copies. tree-sitter convergence deferred
  (availability + a large rewrite); honest UNVERIFIED, not faked.
Conclusion: no risky merge performed (the suite stays green); the real e-graph unification is sequenced into
§1, the spec_* layering is kept, frontend→tree-sitter is deferred. Entropy reduced by MAPPING + the C1/C2 doc fixes.

## In progress / planned (NATIVE-CORE directive)
- §0.5 cleanup: **C1 HANDOFF ✅ · C2 STATUS.md (this) + archive ✅ · C3 key wording ✅ · C4 mapped (e-graph→§1) ✅ · C5 versioning ✅ · C6 perf↔correctness gates ✅ · C-process stale-doc test ✅**.
- **§3 ✅** AST-depth fast-triage before the proof cache (`proof_triage.py`; deterministic route, lossless verdict;
  regression demonstrated + fixed in `proof_cache.measure_triage`; `test_native_s3_triage_layer`).
- **§2 ✅** ZERO-DEPENDENCY bit-blasting SMT (`bitblast_smt.py`: in-house DPLL SAT + bit-blaster + independent
  certificate checker — no coqc/cvc5/Bitwuzla/Lean/Z3). Decides QF-bitvector (add/sub/mul-by-const/and/or/xor/not/
  shift/eq/ult), EXACT *within the stated width* (bound = 2^w), deterministic (same result **and** certificate),
  every SAT model re-checked by a tiny TCB. Wired into `pillar3/bv_validate.bv_equiv_inhouse` and cross-checked
  against Z3 on the sound peepholes (`cross_check_inhouse_vs_z3` → all agree); `test_native_s2_bitblast_smt`.
  **Honest scope (§X):** NOT cvc5/Z3 parity — no signed `>`, no division, no ite-mux, no arrays/reals/unbounded
  ints; the overflow-unsafe peepholes (signed/division/ite) stay on Z3. Small TCB, zero deps — that's the point.
- **§1 ✅** dependency-0 Rust core (`rust_core/` std-only cdylib via ctypes — no PyO3/maturin/cffi/flint/faer;
  `rust_core.py` bridge). Delivers the v34-deferred pieces: flat **arena AST** (one deterministic pass);
  **deterministic fixed-precision multimodular CRT ring** — Garner-combines residues over a fixed 4-prime basis
  into the EXACT integer (native big-uint), replacing Python bignum, EXACT while |v| ≤ MAX_ABS = (∏p−1)/2 (123-bit;
  beyond it the basis must widen or DECLINE — the wrap is exactly at the bound, stated honestly); bounded
  **rational reconstruction**; **deterministic fixed-reduction-order** modular dot (the "SIMD" demonstrator: pure
  integer + fixed order ⇒ bit-identical regardless of vectorization/threads). Verified: Rust≡Python differential +
  a FORMAL exhaustive-bounded equivalence (12,789 enumerated arena×assignment checks, 0 mismatches) + exhaustive
  CRT round-trip. `test_native_s1_rust_core`. **Measured honestly:** no speed crossover at this granularity (ctypes
  overhead vs C-fast CPython int) ⇒ speed **UNVERIFIED**, correctness is the deliverable (mirrors the v40-phase7 RNS
  honesty). Native rewrite changes RUNTIME not GRADES; `target/` is environment-built (gitignored), Python ring is
  the verified fallback — never faked.
- Next: **§4** multi-LLM routing abstraction + high-fidelity offline mock · **§5** dependency elimination. Native
  build / live egress stay **UNVERIFIED** where the sandbox blocks, Python path verified-fallback — never faked.

## Known flakes (load-induced, NOT regressions — pass in isolation)
`test_round2_sublinear_sketches` (HLL ε near boundary), `test_pillar3_stage2_compounding_loop` (timing),
absolute-threshold perf gates (`test_v40_phase2_structured_matrices`, `test_foldext2_stage*`). C6 splits these
perf assertions out of the correctness suite so "0 regression" holds on any hardware.

## Version scheme (C5 — one monotonic timeline; legacy labels mapped)
Build numbering is the git history on this branch. Legacy labels map onto one timeline:
`v4–v40` (early kernels) → `MEGA`/`PILLAR3 stage0–5` (CODE engine) → `OMEGA Rounds 1–3` (CODE breadth) →
`MATH-Ascent §1–§8 + §B1–B4` (MATH mode) → **NATIVE-CORE** (current). Going forward: one scheme — this file's
"Now building" line + git history. No new v-numbers / campaign names.

## Deploy (one user action)
Render (Docker): set **Branch = `claude/charming-brahmagupta-q4wwgh`**, Root `.`, Dockerfile `./Dockerfile`,
Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy. Routes/CMD/`/api/math/*` verified locally; rebuild is the user's action.
Details: `DEPLOY_NOTES.md`.

## Document map
Root keeps only: `README.md`, `HANDOFF.md` (onboarding), **`STATUS.md`** (this), `DEPLOY_NOTES.md`, and
`NATIVE_CORE_REPORT.md` (when the native work lands). All historical campaign reports → `reports/archive/`.
