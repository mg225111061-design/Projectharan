    the verifier never trusts the proposer. ★ REGRESSION ★: feed the IDENTICAL code-generation task through

    this is deterministic and needs no network/key) and assert both runs produce the SAME grade via the

    availability/execution, not just code-verification — `router.select_tools`/`executor.execute` are
    structurally provider-BLIND (neither even accepts a `provider` parameter, so neither could discriminate
    by it if it tried); the ONLY provider-dependent step anywhere in the tool path is Ollama's live
